## The README for BIOL5153

#### Argparse
Attempted to use the filter_fasta_by_length.py code to apply to my parseGFF.py code but ran into some issues. Hopefully I can resolve some of these issues before class tomorrow. 041018
Update: 041118: backbone of code was ok, but I had added a bunch of things from the internet that were NOT needed. Tips for the future include trying to use the information provided to me from the class/book to solve my issues. 
Code works well now!
#### Homework 5 -ParseGFF.py

This was a huge challenge for me as I had to learn a lot of new funtions on my own. I was able to pull out the start and stop locations but the I wasn't able to use that information to pull the data from watermelon.fsa
Hopefully tomorrow in class we will go over this more. 
Update: 041018
Haley and Andy helped me get this code to work. Now need to use argparse so the code will be more versatile
